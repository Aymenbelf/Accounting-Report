These two reports represent comprehensive accounting summaries. The first table provides an overview of financial commitments and guarantees for both resident and non-resident entities, in dinars and foreign currencies. While the second one categorizes financial engagements by risk class (Classe 0, Classe 1, Classe 2, Classe 3) and sector of activity, detailing unpaid amounts (Impay√©s). Each row identifies a different sector by code and label.
